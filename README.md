# Classified: Top Secret
Classified: Top Secret is a strategic game of espionage, courage, and resistance set in the heart of occupied Belgium during World War II. Take command of a covert resistance network as you fight to undermine the occupying forces, gather vital intelligence, and protect your fellow citizens.

## Game Features
* Historical Setting: Immerse yourself in the tension and danger of 1942 Belgium, divided into five distinct districts.
* Strategic Gameplay: Recruit operatives, and plan missions to disrupt enemy plans and aid the resistance.
* Dynamic Resistance Network: Adapt to ever-changing threats and challenges as your choices shape the course of the resistance.
* Compelling Storytelling: Follow gripping narratives of bravery and sacrifice inspired by real historical events.

## How to Play
In Classified: Top Secret, you’ll engage in a cycle of actions to grow your network and push back against the occupying forces:

* SURVEILLANCE: Identify potential sympathisers by carefully monitoring activity in the districts.
* PROPAGANDA: Win over identified sympathisers to join your cause and bolster your resistance network.
* ESPIONAGE: Gather critical Intel from enemy operations and key locations.
* PLANNING: Combine Intel into actionable plans to unleash powerful effects and strike decisive blows against the enemy.

Your ultimate goal is to raise the town's Resistance level high enough to trigger the endgame and liberate the city. But beware! Every action risks raising Heat. If Heat becomes too high, the secret police will crack down, jeopardizing your operatives and potentially ending the resistance.

## About the Game
As the leader of the resistance, you’ll face tough moral choices and logistical challenges. Can you balance the safety of your operatives with the success of high-stakes missions? Each decision will have consequences, determining the fate of the resistance and the people of your town.
